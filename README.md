# Eluv.io ML Project
### We're aiming at telling if `years` played an important role in the relationship between `up_votes` and `country`.
`Analysis.ipynb` processed the raw data and constructed a matrix, wrote the data with the matrix to a new file `df_w_matrix.csv`.
\
`Analysis2.ipynb` took a few primary look at the processed data and cleaned it to another file `df_years.csv`.
\
Read `report.pdf` for my report.
